# Udacity nanodegree MLOps: Genre Classification
Final exercise 14 of Udacity MLOps class to inform about machine learning workflows by using the tools Hydra, MLflow and Weights&Biases.
To use this release you need to be logged in into wandb (wandb login). 

My note:<br>
For implementation the course requested to start with Python 3.8, therefore an associated virtual environment has been created. But during the workflow of Hydra, MLflow and W&B these tools are moving to Python 3.10 and Python 3.11. Therefore all config files of the course have been changed. Todays library versions are added with taking care of installation via pip or conda. Some libraries must be installed by pip or conda. If this doesn't fit several error messages will occur according lib dependencies or not beeing backward compatible for called functions or classes. Using the Udacity solution is not going to work. Therefore this release package has been changed in several coding files as well. It will not work without such changes.
